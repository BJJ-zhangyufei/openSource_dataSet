Any endpoint can ask for the capabilities of a device using the capability exchange request response operation. The device shall indicate all its ONVIF compliant capabilities through the GetCapabilities command. The capability list includes references to the addresses (XAddr) of the service implementing the interface operations in the category. Apart from the addresses, the capabilities only reflect optional functions.
