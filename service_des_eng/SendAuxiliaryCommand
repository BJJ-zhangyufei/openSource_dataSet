Manage auxiliary commands supported by a device, such as controlling an Infrared (IR) lamp,  a heater or a wiper or a thermometer that is connected to the device. The supported commands can be retrieved via the AuxiliaryCommands capability. Although the name of the auxiliary commands can be freely defined, commands starting with the prefix tt: are  reserved to define frequently used commands and these reserved commands shall all share the "tt:command|parameter" syntax.  A device that indicates auxiliary service capability shall support this command.
