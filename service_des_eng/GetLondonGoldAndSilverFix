London Gold And Silver Fixing DetailTHE LONDON GOLD & SILVER FIXINGS: The Fixings are an open process at which market participants can transact business on the basis of a single quoted price. Orders can be changed throughout the proceedings as the price is moved higher and lower until such time as buyers' and sellers' orders are satisfied and the price is said to be 'fixed'. The fixings are the internationally published benchmarks for precious metals. They are fully transparent and are therefore used to deal in large amounts, or to achieve the accepted average price of the metal. As a benchmark, many other financial instruments are priced off the fixing, including cash-settled swaps and options. The silver fixing started in 1897 and the gold fixing in 1919.Get London Gold and Silver fixings
